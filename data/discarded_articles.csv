Since 1987, an integrated strategy has been adopted for the control of soil-transmitted nematodiasis in Jiangsu Province; however, the core interventions varies at different stages, which mainly include deworming, water and sanitation service improvement, health education, and monitoring and assessment. The criteria of effective soil-transmitted nematodiasis control had been achieved in all epidemic counties (districts) of Jiangsu Province by 2019. Further actions to strengthen health education and monitoring and implement precision control measures are required to consolidate the achievements of soil-transmitted nematodiasis control and eliminate the harm of soil-transmitted nematodiasis to humans.

36464265,[Artificial intelligence facilitates tropical infectious disease control and research].,"Since the global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in late 2019, artificial intelligence technology has shown increasing values in the research and control of tropical infectious diseases. The introduction of artificial intelligence technology has shown remarkable effectiveness to reduce the diagnosis and treatment burdens, reduce missing diagnosis and misdiagnosis, improve the surveillance and forecast ability and enhance the medicine and vaccine development efficiency. This paper summarizes the current applications of artificial intelligence in tropical infectious disease control and research and discusses the important values of artificial intelligence in disease diagnosis and treatment, disease surveillance and forecast, vaccine and drug discovery, medical and public health services and global health governance. However, artificial intelligence technology suffers from problems of single and inaccurate diagnosis, poor disease surveillance and forecast ability in open environments, limited capability of intelligent system services, big data management and model interpretability. Hereby, we propose suggestions with aims to improve multimodal intelligent diagnosis of multiple tropical infectious diseases, emphasize intelligent surveillance and forecast of vectors and high-risk populations in open environments, accelerate the research and development of intelligent management system, strengthen ethical security, big data management and model interpretability.",1005-6661,Zhongguo xue xi chong bing fang zhi za zhi = Chinese journal of schistosomiasis control,(34) 445-452,2022,L,Shi,L,"Jiangsu Institute of Parasitic Diseases, National Health Commission Key Laboratory of Parasitic Disease Control and Prevention, Jiangsu Provincial Key Laboratory on Parasite and Vector Control Technology, Wuxi, Jiangsu 214064, China.",False

As an important branch of artificial intelligence, machine learning has been widely used in multiple fields. Predictive models created based on patients' clinical characteristics, laboratory tests, and imaging examinations are effective for prediction and evaluation of clinical diagnosis, therapeutic efficacy and prognosis, as well as detection of outbreaks. Machine learning modeling has the advantages of high efficiency, high accuracy and interpretability as compared to traditional modeling approaches, which provides a new tool for diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases.
